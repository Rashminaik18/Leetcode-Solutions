# LEETCODE 704: BINARY SEARCH

## BRUTE FORCE APPROACH

### How this program works?
- Inputs the array and the target element from the user.
- Loops from the bginning of the array to the ending to check if the array element at any point in the loop is equal to the target element
- If yes: index of its position is returned.
- If no: -1 is returned thus indicating that no such element is present in the array of these elements.
